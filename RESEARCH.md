# Introduction
Targeted individuals are researching an undisclosed bidirectional BCI that was extended in a private research lab to work from a distance. "BCIs measure brain activity and translate it into commands for a computer or other device, allowing users to control machines and devices using only their thoughts." [1]
"Unidirectional BCIs either receive signals from the brain or send them to it, while bidirectional BCIs allow for information exchange in both directions, enabling control of external devices by the brain." [1]

## Research question
Is the clandestine communication experienced by targeted individuals detectable on EEG?

## Theoretical framework
[Speech Perception] -- [BCI] -- [EEG data recording] -- [EEG data analysis] -- [signal processing] -- [AI feature detection] 

# Method
This study will use a controlled experiment as its research method. 
It is a controlled experiment with a cheap BCI device (Muse 2).
A targeted individual will record his EEG stream and label times in the EEG stream from/to when clandestine communication was heard.
Then, an AI model will be trained from a data set of labeled recorded EEG data.
The AI model will be implemented in Python to perform feature detection.
The AI model's capability in detecting the hidden communication will be evaluated on a real-time EEG stream with 
30 new samples that were previously not in the training.
